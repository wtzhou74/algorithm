Comparison of NumberOfIsland.java and WordSearch.java
===> BACKTRACKING
===> !!!!!!!Word.equals(solution)  => Get TLE for some cases since for each solution, it MUST collect word.length's LETTERs.
============================> REPLACEMENT: String to Array => Check EACH letters one by one, the IDEAL case is check ONE letter.

2D Array ===> Graph   ======> CourseSchedule.java

Tarjan Algo:  =====>  CriticalRouters.java


===> One level equals a step/minute , rather than a single movement, e.g. up/down/left/right
	====>Minimum Distance from one point to another =====> BFS  ========> Calculate the number of LEVEL =======> RottingOranges.java; ZombieInMatrix.java; TreasureIsland.java
