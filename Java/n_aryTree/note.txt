For post-order, when track back, we should recognize whether the node has been VISITED OR NOT, => define PAIR(boolean visited, Node node), 
	MAP is not good option here
	=>Reference to POST-ORDER of BINARY TREE SEARCH
	
For N-ary tree, post-order (LEFT-RIGHT-ROOT) is the REVERSE of ROOT-RIGHT-LEFT ("PRE-ORDER") => Collection.reverse(list);

For level-order, 
-	Recursive solution: WHEN TO CREATE A NEW LEVEL AND INCREASE DEPTH
- 	Iterative solution: Make sure know the SIZE of each level => queue.size()

Recursively record DEPTH of n-ary tree.
