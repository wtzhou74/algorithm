System Design:
- Functional Requirements / Use Cases - Spend max of 5 mins here. (Note: not asking questions is red flag)
- Non-Functional Requirements/NFR (scalability, latency, CAP, durability etc)- 2 minutes
- Back of the envelope (capacity) estimations - Spend max of 2-5 mins.
- Generic High Level Design (HLD)-- covering in-flow and outflow of data -- 5-10 mins
- Data Model / APIs (as applicable) - 5 mins
- Scale each component in HLD depending on NFR - 10 mins
- Verify your design / Discuss trade-offs of your design with interviewer (important) - 5 mins
