# Implement int sqrt(int x).
# 
# Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
# 
# Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: 4
# Output: 2
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: 8
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
#              the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
# =============================================================================

# Time: O(logn) = => n * 1/2 * 1/2 *... = 1 ==> binary search can be used for doing SQRT()
# Space: O(1)
