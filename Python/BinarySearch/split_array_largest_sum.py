# =============================================================================
# Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.
# Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
# 
# Note:
# If n is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:
# 
# 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000
# 1 â‰¤ m â‰¤ min(50, n)
# Examples:
# 
# Input:
# nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
# m = 2
# 
# Output:
# 18
# 
# Explanation:
# There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
# The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
# where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
# =============================================================================

# Time: O(nlogs): s is the sum of nums
# Space: O(1)
